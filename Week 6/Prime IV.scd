Prime IV - Vincent Giles (2016) [For WeeklyBeats2016]
****
This piece will use prime number series as the frequency envelopes for a series of additive synthetic percussive sounds. 
Additionally, these synthetic percussive sounds will be interjected with a noise, which again uses the prime number series to modify
a freqyency cutoff.
****
Sequencing will be based upon prime numbers again.
****
This will be the final in the series of prime number SuperCollider studies.
